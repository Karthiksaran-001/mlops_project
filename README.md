# End to End Mushroom Classification Project Using MLOPS 

**EdiFungi: Prepare Machine Learning Model to Safeguard Foragers by Distinguishing Poisonous from Edible Mushrooms**

### Description of the Project 
Mushrooms are a popular ingredient in many cuisines around the world. However, identifying edible and
poisonous mushrooms can be a challenge, even for experienced foragers. The consumption of poisonous
mushrooms can lead to serious health consequences, including death. Insome countries, accidental ingestion of
toxic mushrooms is a leading cause of poisoning. To mitigate the risk of consuming poisonous mushrooms, we
propose the use of a Machine Learning Techniques to classify mushrooms as either edible or poisonous.
Our approach involves training the dataset of mushroom with specific features and labelled as either edible or poisonous, to
enable it to recognize and classify new images. In this project, we use Python's Streamlit framework to
implement a user- friendly graphical interface that allows users to add the feature a mushroom and
receive an instant classification as either edible or poisonous. The goal of thisproject is to provide an effective
tool for mushroom identification that can helpprevent potentially deadly mushroompoisonings. 
The overarching objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model capable of predicting the edibility status of mushrooms, discerning between poisonous and edible varieties, leveraging a comprehensive set of features that encapsulate various attributes such as cap shape, cap surface, gill characteristics, stem dimensions, veil properties, and spore print color. Through extensive analysis and predictive modeling, the goal is to create a reliable tool for differentiating between mushroom types, ensuring the safety of individuals engaging in mushroom foraging or related activities.
